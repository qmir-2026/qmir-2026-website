title: "404: Page Not Found"
---

Why wasn’t this page found?

**Rational choice**:

You maximized utility by clicking the wrong link.

**Collective action**:

Everyone expected someone else to build the page.

**Path dependence**:

A small coding decision in 2003 locked us into this outcome.

**Omitted variable bias**:

The page exists -- we just failed to control for it.

**Endogeneity**:

Your search caused the page not to load.

**Multicollinearity**:

The page was there, but it was perfectly correlated with another one.

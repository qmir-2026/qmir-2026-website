Please indicate how much you agree or disagree with the following statements:\n(Likert scale: strongly disagree → strongly agree)\n\nStatistical analysis is mainly about determining whether a hypothesis is true or false.\n\nEmpirical data can increase or decrease our confidence in a theoretical claim.\n\nUncertainty should be explicitly reported when presenting empirical results.\n\nScientific knowledge is always provisional and subject to revision with new data.\n\nA single statistical result can definitively prove or disprove a theory.\n\nModels are simplifications of reality rather than exact representations.\n\nB2. When you see a numerical result in a paper (e.g., an estimate or coefficient), what are you usually most interested in?\n(Select up to two)\n\nWhether it is “statistically significant”\n\nThe size of the effect\n\nThe uncertainty around the estimate\n\nWhether the result fits the theory\n\nWhether the model assumptions seem plausible\n\nI am usually unsure how to interpret such results"
